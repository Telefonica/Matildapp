    SWC: 115
    CWE RELATED: CWE-477
    Title: Authorization through tx.origin
    Description: tx.origin is used for finding the wallet that triggered the original transaction.
                 Can be used for Phising if a wallet calls a malicious smart contract.
                 Can be catastrophic if the wallet is a multisig wallet, as it will only store the
                 reference to the person who triggered the last vote.

    Detection cases: Can occur when tx.origin is used.
        1. tx.origin appears in the code
        2. tx.origin is in a comment
        Final conlcusion: 1 && !2
